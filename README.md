# Puma-Robot-Simulation

This is a Simulation of a Puma 762 manipulator capable of solving the Forward and Inverse Kinematics problems.
The Code can also be found in https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59663-puma-robot-simulation and is based on '3D Puma Robot Demo' from Don Riley.
Some changes were made to the functions so as to give a more complete solution for the inverse kinematics problem (position and orientation).
The GUI has been enhanced with some new features. An 'Inverse Kinematics' panel for IK variables input, Radiobuttons for viewing different solutions, a 'D-H parameters' table and a 'Transformation matrix' table.
The 'Demo' button has been changed to 'Draw' with some new 'drawings' available.
